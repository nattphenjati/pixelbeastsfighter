# pixelbeastsfighter
Exploring Web3 by creating a simple turn-based fighting game using Pixel Beasts NFT.

If you want to run this locally, install node.js and type "npm run serve" in your terminal.
If you want to deploy it on your server as a static page, remove "node_modules" and "package.json"

All works are in progress. If you would like to help with this project, DM me "Natt#1945" in PixelBeasts Discord.
