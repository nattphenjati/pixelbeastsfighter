Exploring Web3 by turn-based fighting game using Pixel Beasts NFT

"pb-fighter-frontend" folder contains HTML, CSS, and Vue.js file. You can add new CSS in extra.css

"pb-fighter-metamask" folder is where the code is integrated with MetaMask.

All works are in progress. If you would like to help with this project, DM me "Natt#1945" in PixelBeasts Discord.
